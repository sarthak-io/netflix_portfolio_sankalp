## 🎬 Sankalp Chaturvedi — Netflix Inspired Portfolio

This repo powers my playful-but-professional homepage inspired by the Netflix browsing experience. I'm a Delhi NCR based director, writer, cinematographer and colourist. The app highlights my filmography, colour work, festival credentials and contact info using cinematic UI flourishes.

## ✨ What's inside?

- **Top Picks for collaborators** – Custom profile flows for directors, writers, colourists and cinephiles.
- **Filmography timeline** – A vertical timeline that showcases recent shorts, features and training.
- **Skills, awards and projects** – Modular cards that can be edited from code or from a CMS when tokens are provided.
- **Contact CTA** – A stylised badge with direct email/phone links.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- ⚛️ React + TypeScript
- 🎨 CSS Modules & custom motion design
- 📦 Create React App tooling
- 🌐 (Optional) DatoCMS for dynamic content – the components now include graceful fallbacks so the site stays useful even without tokens.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
npm install
npm start
```

If you plan to hook the UI back into DatoCMS, create a `.env` with the appropriate `REACT_APP_DATOCMS_*` tokens mentioned in `src/queries/getDatoCmsToken.ts`.
